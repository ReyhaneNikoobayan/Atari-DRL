# Atari-DRL

## Overview

This repository contains **my implementations** of **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** algorithms for training agents on **Atari 2600 games**.  
I implemented the full training pipeline, including environment setup, agent learning, evaluation, and logging.

This project is intended for:
- Studying and experimenting with DRL algorithms
- Training agents on classic Atari benchmarks
- Reproducing and extending reinforcement learning research

The codebase is structured to allow easy integration of new algorithms, environments, and experimental settings.
